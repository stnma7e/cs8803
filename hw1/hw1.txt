1.a 
b[a-z]+(d|m)


1.b


1.c?
0 1 01 10 11 010 011
(0(1|10|11)?)*|(1(0|1)?)*


2.a
a|(aa)|(aaa)|...|(a {k times})


2.b
a(aaaa|aaa|aa|a)?(bb|b)?b


2.c
Maybe, can I draw a diagram of this? Where there is a state for having 1b, 2b's, 3b's, ..., 6'bs to try and keep track of how many b's I've seen so far, and then each of these states has its own sub-DFA that keeps the tally going. Perhaps the sub-DFA would refer back to one of the existing b-count states.
